# Backend for the 2024 [QLFuture quantum hackaton](https://www.psnc.pl/ql-future-hackathon-2024/).

For backend requests the FastAPI was used since the quantum algorithm part was implemented in Qiskit. 

Deployed to Render.com with free version, so it might take a while to boot up: https://qlfuturebackend.onrender.com/docs

Quantum algorithm created and implemented by Marco Marcozzi.
